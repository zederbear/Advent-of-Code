# Advent of Code 2024 - Go Lang Solutions
## Overview
This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code, written in Go.
I hadn't used Go prior to this challenge so the goal was to **learn the language while solving problems.**

I successfully completed Days 1-5 independently, with later Days being a guided learning process using AI and the Go Documentation.
***
## Learning Journey
- First time with Go: I picked up Go as I went using the [Go API](https://pkg.go.dev/std).
- Problem Solving Approach:
  - For days 1-5 I worked through the problem myself, occasionally asking AI for the name of a function I wanted to use but didn't know the name of
  - If that function didn't exist I would have to create my own function for it.
    - Ex: The sum function was not part of Go's Standard library so on Day 1 I had to create my own Sum function
  - From Day 6 and onwards, I attempted to solve each puzzle for about an hour before asking ChatGPT to solve it to understand my mistakes and improve my Go skills
- Limitations: I no longer have access to my code from Day 6 and onwards so only my solutions for Days 1-5 are listed here

## Reflections
- Advent of Code was a chance to practice coding skills under time pressure of beating my classmates in our class Leaderboard
- I strengthened my debugging skills and the ability to read and apply Documentation
- Even though I relied on using AI for later problems, I got exposed to more advanced Go patterns and syntax than I would have alone

## Updates on later Days (16+)
Eventually I realized that the complexity of the problems outpaced both my own skill in Go and algorithms in general as well as chatGPT's skill unguided by the user, which I did not have enough skill at that point to give chatGPT any extra guidance. At that point I decided to shift my approach, I gave each new puzzle a one time attempt, focusing on what I could learn from the process, and moved on rather than relying on AI to tell me the correct answer.
